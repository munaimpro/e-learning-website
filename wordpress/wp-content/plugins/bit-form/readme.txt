= Does Bit Form includes spam protection?
Yes, Bit Form has built-in spam protection better than any other Contact Form Builder out there. We have included Google reCAPTCHA with compatibility of:

- reCAPTCHA v2 Checkbox
- reCAPTCHA v2 Invisible
- reCAPTCHA v3
- Cloudflare Turnstile
  Additionally, we have included Honeypot anti spam protection. We have implemented the technique differently than any other spam protection plugin has done. We add the honeypot anti spam field from client side (JavaScript) after the form load completes which way the spam bots gets confused and cannot detect the honeypot field. This technique is very effective against spam bots. WP Armour is the only other plugin that has implemented this technique.
